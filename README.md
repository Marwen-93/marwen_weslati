# Machine learning 



## Project 1: Used car price  prediction in Tunisia
[This second project starting from  scratch](https://github.com/Marwen-93/voiture_occasion)

Create a model that can estimate the price of the second-hand car based on some information -Scrap more than 4000 car data from automobile Tunisian website for a second-hand car using python and selenium -Clean the data and extract car name and model from the description -Optimize different model and find the best parameter using grid search cv
## Project 2: Text Emotions Detection with Machine Learning 

Using NLP and machine learning algorithms we can predict text or tweet  writer emotions
